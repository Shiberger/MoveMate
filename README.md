# [MoveMate](https://github.com/Shiberger/MoveMate)
MoveMate is designed to provide an intuitive navigation experience with a focus on exploring and managing destinations. The application allows users to search for locations, save favorite destinations, and get detailed navigation instructions with estimated travel times.
The app is structured around two main tabs:

- MoveMate Map - The primary navigation interface with real-time location tracking, search functionality, and route visualization
- Destinations - A management interface for saved locations with the ability to organize and access favorite destinations

MoveMate showcases advanced iOS mapping capabilities with features like Look Around scene previews and custom style configurations while maintaining a clean, user-friendly interface built on SwiftUI's declarative paradigm.
